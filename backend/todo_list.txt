- Change serializer in user course serializer that accepts a prereqs_met field. Not applicable to
  courses in taken list.
- Add an error guard that checks if prereqs_met is actually valid and if the course has indeed 
  met prereqs. If it hasn't, still accept it but modify the prereqs_met field as needed.
- Bug for stat 230, probably a parent bug
