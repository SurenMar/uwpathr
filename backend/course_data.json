However, we have also altered river form and function towards an 'unnatural' condition. This course analyzes the ways in which humans affect river systems, the physical and social mechanisms which complicate the relationship between humans and rivers, and how humans can restore rivers to a more natural state. This course also compares geomorphic, ecologic, and social functioning of rivers in pre- and post-alteration systems. The major theme of this course is navigating the delicate balance between allowing rivers to flow naturally and maintain ecologic functionality while simultaneously maintaining the river's ability to provide services of use to humans. What does human alteration of river systems mean for the current and future state of river ecology, morphology, and hydrology? Can we find a way for rivers to provide functionality that satisfies the needs of both society and nature? This course provides students with the background and tools to take on these and other essential questions and challenges.",

This course explores eutrophication drivers, pressures, and impacts on the quality of freshwater systems, from watershed to global scales. Students will learn about the sources and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients along the aquatic (stream-river-lake) continuum, and ecological responses in receiving water bodies. Environmental thresholds for setting water-quality standards and nutrient criteria will be discussed. Students will learn about agricultural beneficial management practices and wastewater management to reduce nutrient inputs to freshwaters. Students will examine the benefits and challenges of sustainable nutrient stewardship in combatting eutrophication, and learn about how this knowledge is used in water-quality management, through international examples.",

Removal of vegetation by wildfire can alter hydrologic, biogeochemical, and geomorphic processes over a range of spatial and temporal scales in a manner that can be transient or persistent. Alteration of these processes can involve complex responses in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems which pose significant financial, environmental, planning, and management challenges. This course will examine the role of climate warming on wildfire behaviour, the impacts of wildfire on landscape form and function, and its impact on hydrologic and geomorphic processes in wildfire impacted landscapes across the globe.",

You will learn about core issues in research design (e.g., sampling) that transcend specific approaches, and about a variety of techniques for collecting and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data. The course will cover both abstract and practical issues related to methodology and decision making in empirical research. You will have the opportunity to develop and workshop proposals that you may wish to pursue in your senior honours thesis. By the end of the course you will be a more informed consumer and have a basic set of skills for designing and implementing your own empirical research projects. Most importantly, you will have a foundation for future learning about research design and methods.",

After a review of the required mathematics, these tools will be used to derive the least-squares estimator for the standard linear model and to conduct inference about features of the model, checking the results of theory using regression software and economic data. Then this framework will be used for theoretical generalizations of the model and their estimation using regression software. By the end of the course, students will be able to estimate a linear model and conduct accurate inference in cases where economic data violate the assumptions of the standard linear regression model. This includes methods for dealing with heteroskedastic data, observations that may be dependent over time, response distributions with heavy tails or limited range (such as binary outcomes and count variables), and observations that may suffer from selection bias.",

Students will engage in critical readings of primary and secondary sources to learn about the care of bodies, management of disease and contagion, waste disposal, and food distribution in various medieval cities. This work will allow students to explore how notions of \"health\" and \"disease\" are cultural constructions that vary depending on the times and spaces in which they are used. Students will acquire humanities-based skills and theories to interrogate notions of health and well-being both historically and in today's societies.",

Special attention may be given to issues of miscommunication across racial, social, cultural, ethnic, economic, and historic barriers within workplaces and school environments. Students will also explore various approaches used to mitigate ethno-racial differences including intercultural fluency, diversity, anti-oppression, and anti-racism training.",

Students explore, understand, and apply different knowledges, worldviews, and intervention frameworks related to distress, mental health, and substance use, including national policy frameworks and Indigenous approaches to wellness and healing. Key topics in mental health and substance use are considered including trauma and trauma-informed services, harm reduction, and recovery-oriented principles and services as they are relevant to social work practice. Students are introduced to community- and peer-based approaches to distress and recovery.",

Students will engage in close readings of primary and secondary sources to explore how and why certain diseases, like cancer and tuberculosis, were understood differently within these three paradigms.
